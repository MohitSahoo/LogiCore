Executive Summary: Inventory Health & Key Concerns**\n\nThis week's inventory report presents a highly unusual and critical situation: we currently hold **zero products** across all categories, resulting in a total inventory value of $0. Consequently, no sales or orders were recorded during this period.\n\nThe primary and overarching concern is the complete absence of any physical inventory. This indicates a fundamental halt in our ability to fulfill orders, generate revenue, or engage in any product-based business activity. While technically we have no overstocked or understocked items, this is due to the lack of any stock whatsoever, not efficient management.\n\n**2. Most Important Issues Needing Immediate Attention**\n\nThe most critical issue is the **absolute lack of inventory**. Without products, the business cannot operate. This situation demands immediate investigation into its root cause:\n*   Is this a new business yet to acquire initial stock?\n*   Has there been a complete cessation of product operations?\n*   Is there a significant data reporting error?\n\nUntil this fundamental issue is resolved, all other inventory",
