# Smart Supply Chain Frontend (React + Vite)

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app expects the backend API to be running on `http://localhost:4000`.

Tabs:

- **Products** – view low‑stock status, create/delete products.
- **Suppliers** – manage suppliers.
- **Orders** – create orders with multiple items; completing an order triggers PostgreSQL inventory updates.
- **Reports & Alerts** – inventory report and low‑stock alerts generated by database triggers.
